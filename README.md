Club Uber, my first website. It uses the PHP-Fusion 7 CMS. It's still available at [clububer.com].

I made this in '08-'10 (approximately 6th to 8th grade) and learned a lot about PHP in the process.

I'm putting this on GitHub for historical purposes. Please do not judge me based off of this code quality!
